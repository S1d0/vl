// Imagine you write a microservice for an online retailer. Your responsibility is to write a component (method in Java) that calculates a total price of user's basket.
// User's basket contains multiple positions, each consisting of both a product and a quantity. Every product has a name (String) and a unit price (number). For simplicity let's assume there are four products: bread [1.99], butter [3.2], milk [2.4], chocolate (5.15] hardcoded somewhere in the code.
// Total price is a sum of unit price x
// quantity of basket positions.
// All validations are out of scope - we assume input is correct.

// Now let's assume we want to have a promotion that if user buys products for the total price above 50, we apply 10% discount.
